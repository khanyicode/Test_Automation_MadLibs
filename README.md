# Java Programming Course Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to the exercises from the free Java Programming course on Test Automation University. It serves as a comprehensive reference for course participants and those learning Java programming and test automation.

## Repository Contents
- Complete solutions to course exercises
- Comprehensive code examples
- Demonstrations of Java programming concepts
- Test automation techniques and implementations

## Learning Objectives
The repository aims to:
- Provide clear, well-documented solutions to course exercises
- Demonstrate best practices in Java programming
- Showcase effective test writing techniques
- Help learners understand core Java programming concepts

## Writing Tests in Java
### Key Testing Approaches
- **JUnit Testing**: The primary testing framework used in the course
- **Test Case Design**: Creating comprehensive test scenarios
- **Assertion Techniques**: Verifying expected outcomes
- **Mock Testing**: Simulating dependencies and isolating test units

### Best Practices
1. Write tests before or alongside implementation code (Test-Driven Development)
2. Ensure tests are:
   - Repeatable
   - Independent
   - Thorough
   - Easy to understand
3. Cover different scenarios including:
   - Normal operation
   - Edge cases
   - Error handling

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
3. Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
4. Run tests using your IDE's testing tools or build systems like Maven or Gradle

## Recommended Tools
- JDK 11 or higher
- JUnit 5
- Maven/Gradle
- IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

## Disclaimer
These solutions are meant for educational purposes. It's recommended to attempt exercises independently before referencing these solutions.
