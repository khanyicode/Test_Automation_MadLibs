/*- Question

Write a Java program that searches a given text to determine if it contains the letter **'A'** (case insensitive).  
The program should stop searching as soon as it finds the letter.

Task:

1. Prompt the user to enter a string.  
2. Use a **for loop** to iterate through each character in the string.  
3. If the letter 'A' (uppercase or lowercase) is found, set a flag to `true` and exit the loop using `break`.  
4. Display an appropriate message indicating whether the letter 'A' was found.*/



public class LetterSearch {
    
}
